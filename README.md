developed by Jesse Pinkman : twitch profile on twitch dev network : https://discuss.dev.twitch.tv/users/jesseepinkmen/activity 

You can check out the Twitch Api in here: https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API

I've used MaahApp for Metro like controls : http://mahapps.com/controls/

You will need to set your ClientId in OAuthData class

If you need anything drop me a line. 

Cheers
