# TwitchViewer
A simple Twitch client that uses Vlc and Livestream to watch twitch streams. 

This was inspired by Twitch Stream V2 :

developed by Jesse Pinkman : twitch profile on twitch dev network : https://discuss.dev.twitch.tv/users/jesseepinkmen/activity 

You can check out the Twitch Api in here: https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API

I've used MaahApp for Metro like controls : http://mahapps.com/controls/

You will need to set your ClientId in OAuthData class

Go to: https://secure.twitch.tv/settings/connections and register a new client 
or go directly to: https://secure.twitch.tv/kraken/oauth2/clients/new

If you need anything drop me a line. 

Cheers
